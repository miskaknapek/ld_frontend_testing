# LD app : to-do list 
———————————————


## New to-do list 

### Short term

- Add a contextual menu 
	- check about making a design that's compatible with both a verticl and horisontal time-slider
	- ideall it's located in the top left … 

### Medium term

- Add a timeslider to the right hand side of the screen, for easier thumb-scrolling, when on mobile. 
	- You could leave the bits for the top-screen horisontal time-slider, the overhead is likely small… 
		… details may vary 

- Think about doing a particle simulatino for wind movement simulation… 
( particle speed relative to wind speed? )


### Long term

- Think about how to include humidity data 
	- Eg look for weather services that gather that data and distribute it.
